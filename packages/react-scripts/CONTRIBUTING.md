## Local development

For now you have to use a local npm Registry like for example [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)

1. Start your local registry
2. Log into your local registry
3. Go to`<PATH_TO>/create-react-app/packages/react-scripts` and do `npm publish` to your local registry
4. Go to a directory of your choice and run the [install command](./README.md#usage) and check out your local app
